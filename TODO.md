Standardize Z sorting so UI elements are always on top, and game pieces are ordered correctly as well
Make enemies have some kind of generic class to abstract from that contains their details. It might make sense to make ability classes and then simply have the enemies have a health, damage, list of abilities with the associated ability level as well as unique abliities in a class.
Create bosses, could be the same as an enemy as well, just could make a unique scene for special effects durnig the boss fight.
Make shops spawn things randomly (need to generate more spawnables first)
Make many differente kitchen objects that all fit a specific genre for the first playable character -> maybe the character will start as a home cook? so could have many general cooking items. later characters could be specific to a baker. (might make more senese to make general stuff aquireable from all characters and have each playable character have a unique niche like drinks, baking, bbq, etc.)
Make a lot of pixel art :,)
