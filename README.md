This is a roguelike baking game I'm devloping inspired by Slay the Spire as well as games like The Bazaaar. I'm combining an autobattler fight with the roguelike formula and having different unique events, encounters, stores and events while you focusing on constructing the best possible kitchen to feed your hungry "customers". I'm currently using placeholder art made by myself in Aesprite and coding in C# in godot. Lots of the code is quite rough as i'm heavily prototyping things at the moment and building up the infrastructure to quickly iterate changes to events, enemies and other parts of the game.
